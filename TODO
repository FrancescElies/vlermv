To do

* Rename `vlermv.cache` to `vlermv.memoize`.
* Remove flippant comments.
* Change "database" language to "dictionary-file mapper".
* Add a discussion at the beginning about shell file access, my distrust
    of my ability to write software that keeps working, and the merits
    of simplicity.


Make an exception like this.

    class InvalidName(ValueError):
        pass

Raise that error if a key cannot be determined. Maybe add a function like
`AbstractVlermv.validate` that goes through all of the `keys` and reports which
ones are bad.
