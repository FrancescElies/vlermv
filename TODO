To do

* Rename `vlermv.cache` to `vlermv.memoize`.
* Remove flippant comments.
* Change "database" language to "dictionary-file mapper".
* Add a discussion at the beginning about shell file access, my distrust
    of my ability to write software that keeps working, and the merits
    of simplicity.
