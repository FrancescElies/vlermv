To do
=======

Documentation

* Remove flippant comments.
* Change "database" language to "file-dictionary-function mapper".
* Add a discussion at the beginning about shell file access, my distrust
    of my ability to write software that keeps working, and the merits
    of simplicity.

Make an exception like this.

    class InvalidName(ValueError):
        pass

Raise that error if a key cannot be determined. Maybe add a function like
`AbstractVlermv.validate` that goes through all of the `keys` and reports which
ones are bad.

Serializers

* I should be able to set an "extension" property of the serializer.
    If this is set, the extension will be appended to filenames.
* I should be able to pass an iterable of serializers, rather than just
    a single serializer. If I do this, the serializers will be composed.

Transformers: Set a regular expression or PyParsing parser or something.

* When loading resources with ``keys()``, emit only resources whose
    filenames match the expression.
* For complicated filenames, you can reference this expression in the
    ``from_path`` and ``to_path`` functions.
* When saving resources, raise an error if the expression is not met.
