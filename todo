* The tuple for exceptions is too confusing; come up with something else,
    or at least document it better.
* Change the default transformer and serializer to identity
* Allow serializers to indicate binaryness.
* Maybe serializers indicate whether they are capable of caching exceptions
  and then vlermv decides whether to cache them?
