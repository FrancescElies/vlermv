Serializers
=======================
Serializers specify how Python objects should be saved to disk and
how files from disk should be read as Python objects.

Components of a serializer
----------------------------
A serializer is a Python object with the following methods.

``dump(obj, fp) -> None``
    Write the object to the file pointer ``fp``.
``load(fp) -> obj``
    Represent the  the file pointer ``fp`` as an object.

It optionally includes two boolean properties.

First, ``vlermv_binary_mode`` indicates whether binary modes be used
for opening file pointers. (Default is ``False``.) If this is ``True``,
pointers will be opened like this. ::

    open(filename, 'rb')
    open(filename, 'wb')

If it is ``False``, filenames will be opened like this.

    open(filename, 'r')
    open(filename, 'w')

Second, ``vlermv_cache_exceptions`` tells us whether the caching of
exceptions is supported. (Default is ``True``.) This is relevant
when the serializer is used with ``vlermv.cache``.

If ``vermv_cache_exceptions`` is ``False``
but :py:class:`vlermv.Vlermv` is initialized with ``cache_exceptions = True``,
an exception is raised.

What exactly is ``obj``?
--------------------------
The ``obj`` that is referenced in the above function signatures is
manipulated if you enable the caching of exceptions. (Exception caching
is disabled by default.)

Default behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If ``Vlermv`` is initialized with ``cache_exceptions = False``,
``obj`` is simply the object that was passed to ``Vlermv.__setitem__``.
This is the default; in the following example ``obj`` is ``8``. ::

    Vlermv('/tmp/a')['b'] = 8 

And in the following case, ``obj`` is ``103``. ::

    @cache(cache_exceptions = False)
    def f(x):
        return x + 3
    f(100) # <- Returns 103

``cache_exceptions`` is ``False`` by default, so the following block is
the same as the previous one. ::

    @cache()
    def f(x):
        return x + 3
    f(100) # <- Returns 103

If exception caching is enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You probably want to set ``cache_exceptions`` only if you are using the
:py:func:`vlermv.cache` decorator, as it doesn't do anything otherwise.

If ``cache_exceptions`` is ``True``, ``obj`` is a tuple of ``(exception, result)``,
where ``result`` is the result of the decorated function.
(If ``cache_exceptions`` is ``False``, ``obj`` is simply ``result``.)

``exception`` is ``None`` if the function ran without error, and ``result``
is ``None`` if there was an error.

Consider the function ``g`` below. ::

    @cache(cache_exceptions = True)
    def g(x):
        return x + 3

It is just like the ``f`` we saw before except with exception caching enabled.
If we call it like we called ``f`` before, ::

    g(100) # returns 103

``obj`` is ``(None, 103)``, because the value ``103`` is returned without error.
The following ``g`` call produces an error, ::

    >>> g('one hundred')
    TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly

In this case, ``obj`` looks like this. ::

    (TypeError("Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"), None)

If exception caching had been disabled, the serializer would never have gotten
called; the error would have been raised but not saved.

Example serializers
---------------------
The :py:mod:`json` module is a valid serializer, ::

    import json

and so is ``simple_identity``. ::

    class simple_identity:
        @staticmethod
        def dump(obj, fp):
            fp.write(obj)

        @staticmethod
        def load(fp):
            return fp.read()

        vlermv_binary_mode = True
        vlermv_cache_exceptions = False

On the other hand, :py:mod:`pickle` does not function properly as a
serializer. ::

    import pickle

This is because pickle requires that file pointers be opened in binary
mode rather than string mode; the Vlermv's default
:py:mod:`vlermv.serializers.pickle` serializer thus has to set
``vlermv_binary_mode`` to ``True``.

Serializers included with Vlermv
------------------------------------
The following serializers are included.

.. py:module:: vlermv.serializers

``vlermv.serializers.identity_str``
    Write raw strings to files.
``vlermv.serializers.identity_bytes``
    Write raw bytes to files.
``vlermv.serializers.pickle``
    Serialize with :py:mod:`pickle`.
``vlermv.serializers.html``
    Serialize HTML trees from `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`.
``vlermv.serializers.xml``
    Serialize XML etrees from `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`.
