Using Vlermv as a dictionary
--------------------------------
Vlermv provides a dictionary-like object
that is associated with a particular directory on
your computer. ::

    from vlermv import Vlermv
    vlermv = Vlermv('/tmp/a-directory')

The keys correspond to files, and the values get serialized to files.
The default serialization is pickle. ::

    vlermv['filename'] = range(100)

    import pickle
    range(100) == pickle.load(open('/tmp/a-directory/filename', 'rb'))

You can also read and delete things. ::

    # Read
    range(100) == vlermv['filename']

    # Delete
    del(vlermv['filename'])
