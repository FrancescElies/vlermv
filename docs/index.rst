Vlermv
==================================

Vlermv provides a dictionary-like object that is associated with a
particular directory on your computer. Here's a three-line introduction.

Install from PyPI. ::

    pip install vlermv

Then call it like this. ::

    from vlermv import Vlermv
    like_a_dictionary = Vlermv('/tmp/a-directory')

Now you can mostly pretend that ``like_a_dictionary`` is a :py:class:`dict`,
except that it will persist across Python sessions.

Vlermv has many other features that you may read about below.
