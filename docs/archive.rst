Using Vlermv as an archive rather than a cache
===============================================

.. I should change the name of the function "cache"
   Oooh maybe I just make vlermv.Vlermv() a decorator!

.. py:func:`vlermv.archive`

The :py:func:`~vlermv.cache` decorator works when you can form a meaningful
filename from the arguments to the function you are decorating. Sometimes
you can't.

I find that I often want to download a webpage every day and save the result
every day. For example, I want to look for new [smoethings] every day on
[website]. Once I download the homepage of this website, I get the URLs for
each [something], and I can use :py:func:`~vlermv.cache`, but how do I save
the homepage?

That is what the :py:func:`~vlermv.archive` [argument? decorator?] is for.

.. py:data:`archive_minutely`
.. py:data:`archive_hourly`
.. py:data:`archive_daily`
.. py:data:`archive_weekly`
.. py:data:`archive_yearly`

The archive decorator simply manipulates the path after the
::::`transformer` has been applied.

There are three components to the archive setting.

Interval
    millisecond, second, minute, hour, day, week, month, default is day
append_random
    Whether to append a random number after the date, just in case there
    are multiple calls within the same millisecond, default is False
position
    left (at the beginning of the path), right (end), replace, default is left

@cache(transformer = vlermv.transformers.archive(vlermv.transformers.tuple)
