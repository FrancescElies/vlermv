Key transformers
----------------------------
Vlermv uses the rather basic :py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.simple`
transformer by default; :py:class:`str` keys are mapped to file names
inside of the
vlermv directory, and writing to subdirectories is not allowed.

Other transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. py:module:: vlermv.transformers

In this section we discuss the transformers that are included in Vlermv.
The default is the simple transformer.

.. py:data:: simple

   Key is used as the file name directory. It must be a string without slashes.

Here are some more complex transformers.

.. py:data:: magic

   Magically figure out a reasonable file name.

.. py:data:: base64

   File name is the base 64 encoding of the key.

.. py:data:: tuple

   Key must be a tuple; the right most element becomes a file name,
   and the preceding elements are directories.

.. py:data:: slash

   Like simple, except that slashes may be used to separate directories

.. py:data:: backslash

   Like simple, except that backslashes may be used to separate directories

The magic transformer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the coolest parts of Vlermv is the
:py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.magic` transformer, as it interprets
keys in a very fancy way, combining the features of the
other transformers.

Aside from strings and string-like objects,
you can use iterables of strings; these indices both refer
to the file :file:`foo/bar/baz`::

    vlermv[('foo','bar','baz')]
    vlermv[['foo','bar','baz']]

(This is like the :py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.tuple` transformer.)

If you pass a relative path to a file, it will be broken up as you'd expect;
that is, strings get split on slashes and backslashes. ::

    vlermv['foo/bar/baz']
    vlermv['foo\\bar\\baz']

(This is like the :py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.slash` and
:py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.backslash` transformers.)

If you pass a URL, it will also get broken up in a reasonable way. ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz
    vlermv['http://thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz']

    # /tmp/a-directory/thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz
    vlermv['thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz']

Dates and datetimes get converted to :code:`YYYY-MM-DD` format. ::

    import datetime

    # /tmp/a-directory/2014-02-26
    vlermv[datetime.date(2014,2,26)]
    vlermv[datetime.datetime(2014,2,26,13,6,42)]

And you can mix these formats! ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/open-data/2014-02-26
    vlermv[('http://thomaslevine.com/open-data', datetime.date(2014,2,26))]

Creating a transformer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A transformer converts keys to paths and paths to keys, where keys
are things that we use to index a :py:class:`~vlermv.Vlermv` object
and paths Vlermv's internal representation of file paths.

In this section I define a "key" and a "path" and then explain how
to implement a transformer for translating between keys and paths.

Keys
^^^^^^^^^^
In the following query, :py:obj:`234` is the key. ::

    Vlermv('tmp')[234]

And in this one, ::

    Vlermv('tmp')[('a', (1, 2))]

:py:obj:`('a'), (1, 2))` is the key.


Paths
^^^^^^^^^^
Internally in Vlermv, paths get represented as tuples of directory
and file names. Here are some examples of how the mapping works.

=============================  =====================
Vlermv tuple path              Ordinary string path 
=============================  =====================
:py:obj:`('./x', 'y', 'z')`    x/y/z              
:py:obj:`('x', 'y', 'z')`      x/y/z              
:py:obj:`('', 'x', 'y', 'z')`  x/y/z              
:py:obj:`('/', 'usr', 'bin')`  usr/bin             
=============================  =====================

Aside from the basic conversion between strings and tuples, the main thing
that is going on here is sandboxing the paths to be descendants of the
vlermv directory; there is no path that you can specify that will let you
read or write outside of the vlermv directory. Here are two examples that
use the magic transformer. ::

    vlermv['/foo/bar/baz'] # Saves to ./foo/bar/baz
    vlermv['C:\\foo\\bar\\baz'] # Saves to ./c/foo/bar/baz
                                # (lowercase "c")

All paths are relative the vlermv root, and absolute directories are
converted to relative paths.

Also, some paths are not allowed. An attempt to use empty paths, paths
resolving to :file:`./`, and relative paths outside of the vlermv root
will raise an error. Here are more complex examples.

===================================    =========================
Vlermv tuple path                      Ordinary string path     
===================================    =========================
:py:obj:`('a', '..', 'b', 'c')`        b/c
:py:obj:`('..', '..', 'bin', 'sh')`    (Not allowed)
:py:obj:`('/', '..')`                  (Not allowed)
:py:obj:`('./', 'd')`                  d
:py:obj:`('./',)`                      (Not allowed)
:py:obj:`('', '', '')`                 (Not allowed)
``tuple()``                            (Not allowed)
===================================    =========================

When tuple paths are created from file names in
:py:func:`vlermv.Vlermv.keys` or  :py:func:`vlermv.Vlermv.items`,
they contain none of the elements:
:py:obj:`'/'`, :py:obj:`'.'`, or :py:obj:`'..'`.
That is, they are normal and relative. For example,
a path :file:`./a/b/c` becomes :py:obj:`('a', 'b', 'c')`.

Transformer API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. py:currentmodule:: vlermv.hypothetical_transformer

Now on to the transformer itself!
A transformer is a Python object with the following methods.

.. py:method:: to_path(key:str) -> path:tuple

    Convert a key to a path.

.. py:method:: from_path(path:tuple) -> key:str

    Convert a path to a key.

For example, this is what the default :py:data:`~vlermv.transformers.simple`
transformer looks like.

.. literalinclude:: ../vlermv/transformers/simple.py
