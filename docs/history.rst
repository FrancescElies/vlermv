History
=====================
I wrote `pickle warehouse <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pickle-warehouse>`_
so I could easily store pickles in files with meaningful names.
Then I extended it to support more than just pickles. Then I wrote
`picklecache <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/picklecache>`_, mainly for caching
responses to HTTP requests.

And then I finally changed the names because these two packages don't really
have much to do with pickles. :py:class:`pickle_warehouse.Warehouse` became
:py:class:`vlermv.Vlermv`, and :py:func:`picklecache.cache` became
:py:func:`vlermv.cache`.
And I have substantially extended both of these since.

I chose the name "vlermv" by banging on the keyboard; this is how I have
been naming things now that I have discovered
`Dada <https://thomaslevine.com/!/dada/>`_.
