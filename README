Vlermv
==================
Vlermv makes it easy to save Python
objects to files with meaningful identifiers.
The package Vlermv provides two interfaces.

Vlermv
    ``vlermv.Vlermv`` is a dictionary interface.
VlermvCache
    ``vlermv.cache`` is a decorator that you can use for caching the output of a function.

Using Vlermv
-------------------
Vlermv provides a dictionary-like object
that is associated with a particular directory on
your computer. ::

    from vlermv import Vlermv
    vlermv = Vlermv('/tmp/a-directory')

The keys correspond to files, and the values get
pickled to the files. ::

    vlermv['filename'] = range(100)

    import pickle
    range(100) == pickle.load(open('/tmp/a-directory/filename', 'rb'))

You can also read and delete things. ::

    # Read
    range(100) == vlermv['filename']

    # Delete
    del(vlermv['filename'])

The coolest part is that the key gets interpreted
in a fancy way. Aside from strings and string-like objects,
you can use iterables of strings; all of these indices refer
to the file ``/tmp/a-directory/foo/bar/baz``::

    vlermv[('foo','bar','baz')]
    vlermv[['foo','bar','baz']]

If you pass a relative path to a file, it will be broken up as you'd expect;
that is, strings get split on slashes and backslashes. ::

    vlermv['foo/bar/baz']
    vlermv['foo\\bar\\baz']

Note well: Specifying an absolute path won't save things outside the vlermv directory. ::

    vlermv['/foo/bar/baz'] # -> foo, bar, baz
    vlermv['C:\\foo\\bar\\baz'] # -> c, foo, bar, baz
                                   # (lowercase "c")

If you pass a URL, it will also get broken up in a reasonable way. ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz
    vlermv['http://thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz']

    # /tmp/a-directory/thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz
    vlermv['thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz']

Dates and datetimes get converted to :code:`YYYY-MM-DD` format. ::

    import datetime

    # /tmp/a-directory/2014-02-26
    vlermv[datetime.date(2014,2,26)]
    vlermv[datetime.datetime(2014,2,26,13,6,42)]

And you can mix these formats! ::

    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/open-data/2014-02-26
    vlermv[('http://thomaslevine.com/open-data', datetime.date(2014,2,26))]

It also has typical dictionary methods like :code:`keys`, :code:`values`, :code:`items`,
and :code:`update`.

Using VlermvCache
-------------------

Better than Mongo
---------------------
Vlermv is nearly better than Mongo, so you should use it anywhere
where you were previously using Mongo. Vlermv is designed for
write-heavy workloads that need scalability (easy sharding), flexible
schemas, and highly configurable indexing.

Things that are missing for a full Mongo replacement

* Protection against inode exhaustion
* Ability to delete an entire directory for atomic edits within a document
* Transactions (Mongo `doesn't have them <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits/>`_, but they would be cool.)
* Indices maybe? In case you want an index on something other than the filename

ACID properties
----------------------------
Atomicity
    Writes are made to a temporary file that gets renamed.
Consistency
    No validation is supported, so the database is always consistent by definition.
Isolation
    Vlermv has isolation within files/documents/values but not across. You may implement your own multi-file transactions.
Durability
    All data are saved to disk right away.
