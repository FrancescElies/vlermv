Vlermv
==================
Vlermv makes it easy to save Python
objects to files with meaningful identifiers.
You should concern yourself primarily with these two elements.

``vlermv.Vlermv``
    Class that helps you use the filesystem like a dictionary.
``vlermv.cache``
    Decorator that helps you use ``vlermv.Vlermv`` for caching the output of a function.
